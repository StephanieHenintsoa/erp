I'll analyze these three CSV files for ERPNext import, identifying their structure, relationships, and potential issues.

## Data Description

**CSV-1 (Material Requests):**
- **DocType:** Material Request
- **Fields:** Date, item name, item group, required by date, quantity, purpose, target warehouse, reference number
- **Purpose:** Represents material requisitions for purchasing items needed by the organization

**CSV-2 (Suppliers):**
- **DocType:** Supplier
- **Fields:** Supplier name, country, supplier type
- **Purpose:** Master data for vendor/supplier information

**CSV-3 (Request for Quotation Items):**
- **DocType:** Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Supplier Quotation
- **Fields:** Reference to material request, supplier name
- **Purpose:** Links material requests to potential suppliers for quotation purposes

## Relationships

The files are connected through the following relationships:

1. **CSV-1 → CSV-3:** The `ref` field in CSV-1 connects to `ref_request_quotation` in CSV-3 (foreign key relationship)
2. **CSV-2 → CSV-3:** The `supplier_name` field in CSV-2 connects to `supplier` field in CSV-3 (foreign key relationship)

This creates a flow: Material Request → Request for Quotation → Supplier selection.

## Potential Import Errors

**CSV-1 Issues:**
- Missing mandatory fields: `item_code`, `company`, `schedule_date`
- Date format inconsistency (DD/MM/YYYY may need conversion to YYYY-MM-DD)
- Invalid warehouse reference ("All Warehouse" may not exist)
- Missing item group validation
- No UOM (Unit of Measure) specified

**CSV-2 Issues:**
- Missing mandatory fields: `supplier_group`, `supplier_type` format validation
- Country names need to match ERPNext's country master data
- No contact information or payment terms

**CSV-3 Issues:**
- Missing mandatory fields: `transaction_date`, `company`
- Foreign key validation failures if referenced suppliers/material requests don't exist
- No item-level details for RFQ

## Recommendations

**Import Sequence:**
1. Import CSV-2 (Suppliers) first - master data dependency
2. Import CSV-1 (Material Requests) second
3. Import CSV-3 (RFQ data) last - depends on both previous imports

**Data Preparation:**
- Standardize date formats to YYYY-MM-DD
- Validate warehouse names against existing warehouse master
- Ensure item codes exist in Item master or create them first
- Add missing mandatory fields (company, supplier_group, etc.)
- Verify country names match ERPNext country master

**ERPNext Import Best Practices:**
- Use Data Import Tool with field mapping validation
- Test with small batches first
- Enable "Skip Errors" option during bulk import
- Validate foreign key references before import
- Use Template downloads from ERPNext for exact field requirements

**Assumptions Made:**
- CSV-1 represents Material Request items rather than complete Material Requests
- "All Warehouse" should be replaced with actual warehouse codes
- Supplier type "Company" is valid in your ERPNext instance
- Reference numbers are unique identifiers for material requests

Consider creating Item master data first if items don't exist, and ensure your ERPNext instance has the referenced warehouses and supplier groups configured before proceeding with the import.


Based on my analysis of the CSV-1 sample data, the `ref` column is **NOT unique**. Here's why:

## Why `ref` is likely NOT unique:

**Evidence from the sample:**
- The sample shows `ref` values 1 and 2, each appearing only once
- However, this appears to represent **Material Request line items**, not complete Material Requests

**Logical reasoning:**
1. **Material Requests typically contain multiple items** - A single purchase request often includes several different items (like your sample: bolts and cement)
2. **Line-level vs Header-level data** - The CSV structure suggests item-level records, where multiple items can belong to the same Material Request
3. **Real-world scenario** - In practice, you'd expect multiple rows sharing the same `ref` number for multi-item requests

**Expected pattern in full dataset:**
```
ref=1: boulon, ciment, screws, nails (multiple items, same request)
ref=2: cement, steel bars, wire (multiple items, same request)
ref=3: paint, brushes (multiple items, same request)
```

## Best Approach for Import:

**1. Data Structure Clarification:**
- **If `ref` represents Material Request numbers:** Group rows by `ref` and create one Material Request per unique `ref` with multiple items
- **If `ref` represents line item numbers:** Each row becomes a separate single-item Material Request

**2. Recommended Import Strategy:**

```python
# Pseudo-approach for ERPNext import
Group CSV-1 data by 'ref' number
For each unique 'ref':
  - Create one Material Request (header)
  - Add all items with same 'ref' as child table entries
  - Use first row's date/warehouse as header values
```

**3. ERPNext Implementation:**
- Use **Material Request** DocType with **Material Request Item** child table
- Map CSV fields to:
  - Header: `ref` → `name`, `date` → `transaction_date`, `target_warehouse` → `set_warehouse`
  - Child table: `item_name` → `item_code`, `quantity` → `qty`, `required_by` → `schedule_date`

**4. Validation Steps:**
- Verify if multiple rows with same `ref` should be grouped
- Ensure item codes exist in Item master
- Validate warehouse names
- Check if `required_by` dates are consistent within same `ref` group

This approach handles both scenarios: whether `ref` is truly unique (unlikely) or represents request numbers with multiple line items (more probable).
